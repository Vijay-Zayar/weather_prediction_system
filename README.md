# weather_prediction_system
Weather prediction is a critical area of study that impacts various aspects of human life and the environment. This presents a weather prediction system leveraging machine learning models, specifically Linear Regression and Ridge Regression, to enhance the accuracy of weather forecasting. We collected and preprocessed historical weather data, including maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, and wind speed, to train and evaluate our models. The Linear Regression model served as a baseline, while the Ridge Regression model was employed to handle multicollinearity and overfitting issues. The results indicate that Ridge Regression outperforms Linear Regression in terms of predictive accuracy, reducing mean squared error and enhancing the robustness of the model. This analysis demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques in improving weather prediction and highlights the importance of addressing regularization techniques in weather forecasting models.

The development and implementation of a weather prediction system utilizing machine learning models, specifically Linear Regression and Ridge Regression, within the Jupyter Notebook environment using Python has shown promising results and significant potential. Throughout this project, we have highlighted several key points: Data Preprocessing, Model Selection, Regularization, Evaluation Metrics, and Model Interpretability. By continually refining and enhancing the system, we can contribute to more reliable and precise weather predictions.
