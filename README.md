# weather_prediction_system
This presents a weather prediction system leveraging machine learning models, specifically Linear Regression and Ridge Regression, to enhance the accuracy of weather forecasting. We collected and preprocessed historical weather data, including maximum temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, and wind speed, to train and evaluate our models.
